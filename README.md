# LiveLikeAI

LiveLikeAI is a productivity app I created after struggling with time management in my first year. I searched for online tools that could help, but nothing worked the way I needed — so I built one myself.  

The app uses a **smart scheduling engine** that organizes tasks based on **priority, time requirements, and deadlines**, ensuring you focus on what matters most. It also includes an **AI chatbot** to provide assistance, motivation, and flexible planning support.
